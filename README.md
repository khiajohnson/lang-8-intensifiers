# lang-8-intensifiers

Intensifier usage by English learners on a language-exchange social media site (scraper &amp; exploratory analysis). This was a project I completed as part of LING 530 &mdash; *Social Media Sociolinguistics* &mdash; I course I took at UBC the spring in 2019. There are three files:

 1. The PDF writeup describing the project (the project focus was on learning the tools, hence the very basic and not-very-interesting research question)
 2. Python notebook for the scraping code (written for use with https://lang-8.com/)
 3. Python notebook for the analysis, which is exploratory and also involves multinomial logistic regression
